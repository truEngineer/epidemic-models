Some models for mathematical modelling of infectious disease.

- The **SIR model** is one of the simplest [compartmental models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology), and many models are derivatives of this basic form. The model consists of three compartments: **S** for the number of *susceptible*, **I** for the number of *infectious*, and **R** for the number of *recovered* or *deceased* (or *immune*) individuals. This model is reasonably predictive for infectious diseases which are transmitted from human to human, and where recovery confers lasting resistance.
